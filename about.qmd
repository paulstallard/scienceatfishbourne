Science at Fishbourne is an informal group for people interested in the broad area of science.
The group meets on the last Monday of each month at 10am.
Each meeting is focussed around a presentation from a guest speaker.
The presentations normally last about an hour, followed by tea/coffee and then Q&A.

The group has been running for XXX and has steadily grown over that time.
We are always happy to welcome new people to the group, and are especially keen to hear from people who might want to present.

There is no membership fee.
Attendees pay £3 on the door to cover costs (eg hall hire).
Each month the group makes a donation to a charity chosen by that month's speaker.

For regular attendees, we have an annual subscription option for just £24.

The group is run by Rodney Wing and Lynn Taylor.
Lynn takes excellent notes on each talk, which are distributed to the mailing list and posted here.

If you have any questions, feel free to [contact us](contact.qmd).

Alternatively, [subscribe to the mailing list](subscribe.qmd) and we will keep you informed of future talks.


Thank you,

Rod & Lynn
