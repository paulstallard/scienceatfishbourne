Interested in science? Join us on 4th Monday of each month at 10am for presentations by researchers and practising scientists followed by discussion.

There is a charge of £3 at the door to cover costs.
An annual payment option is also available.

Presentations usually last an hour.

After the presentation we take a 20-minute tea/coffee/chat break before a Q&A session with the presenter.

We meet at the Fishbourne Centre in Fishbourne. See the [Find Us](location.qmd) page for full details.
