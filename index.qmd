Interested in science?

Join us on 4th Monday of each month (see below for a list of dates) at 10am for presentations by researchers, practising scientists and industrialists followed by discussion.

There is a charge of £3 at the door to cover costs or an annual payment option of £24 is also available.

Presentations usually last an hour.

After the presentation we take a 20-minute tea/coffee/chat break before a Q&A session with the presenter.

We meet at the Fishbourne Centre in Fishbourne. See the [Find Us](location.qmd) page for full details.
