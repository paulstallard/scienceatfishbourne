# Overview

In this talk we'll look at some of the key technology behind today's streaming platforms and find out:

- how they deliver very high bandwidth video over limited bandwidth connections
- how they scale to millions of concurrent streams
- how reliability is achieved
- how data, machine learning and AI are used for everything from recommendations to marketing, content buying and ad insertion

Along the way we'll answer a few common questions, such as:

- Why doesn't the BBC show the clock before the news anymore?
- What are those squares I sometimes see on the TV? (especially if it's raining or windy)
- Why is BBC1 on iPlayer 30 seconds or more behind BBC1 on TV?
- Why do I get recommended things I've already watched?
