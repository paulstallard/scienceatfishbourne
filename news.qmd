    <h3>Physicist Brian Cox explains quantum physics in 22 minutes</h3>
        <b>www.youtube.com</b>
    <p class="text">With a topic as seemingly complicated as quantum physics, where can you start if you want to build your understanding? In just 22 minutes, physicist and professor Brian Cox unpacks the subatomic world, beginning with the theories as we understand
    them today.

    <h3>A nanoparticle-based wireless deep brain stimulation system that reverses Parkinson's disease</h3>
        <b>pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</b>
    <p class="text">Deep brain stimulation technology enables the neural modulation with precise spatial control but requires permanent implantation of conduits. Here, we describe a photothermal wireless deep brain stimulation nanosystem capable of eliminating α-synuclein aggregates and restoring degenerated dopamine n …

    <h3>Book recommendation: How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog</h3>
        <b>www.simonandschuster.co.uk</b>
    <p class="text">A few of us have been reading this book. The author takes us through the core concepts of quantum physics by explaining them to his dog! It's well written and very enjoyable. Although it's reasonably accessible, some of the concepts are complex (quantum teleportation...) and might benefit from a second reading. The official blurb:
    </p>
    <p class="text">Emmy is no ordinary dog. When adopted from the shelter by physics professor Chad Orzel, she becomes immediately fascinated by his work. Could she use quantum tunnelling to get through the neighbour’s fence? How about diffracting round a tree to chase squirrels? Or using virtual particles to catch bunnies made of cheese?
    </p>
    <p class="text">Taking Emmy’s anarchic behaviour as a starting point, Orzel explains the key theories of quantum physics. From quarks and gluons to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, this is a uniquely entertaining way to unlock the secrets of the universe.

    <h3>Eating more polyphenols could be the secret to a longer, healthier life. Here’s how</h3>
        <b>www.sciencefocus.com</b>
    <p class="text">Polyphenols are ring like structures composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. It’s these unique structures that play a crucial role in the biological reasons behind polyphenol’s health benefits including antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Foods such as olives, plums, hazelnuts and tea all contain high levels of polyphenols.

    <h3>Dietary Supplements: Herbals and Botanicals - 9.370 - Extension</h3>
        <b>extension.colostate.edu</b>
    <p class="text">Herbals and botanicals have been used medicinally for thousands of years. Once thought of as ‘traditional medicine’ used by native or ancient cultures, herbal medicine has emerged as a popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or supplement to modern medicine. The herbal market is growing steadily at about 20% each year, and it is estimated that in the United States alone the sale of botanical dietary supplements exceeded $5.3 billion in 2011.
