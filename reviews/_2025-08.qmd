Magic happens in our homes and as we travel. We push a button, swipe a
finger across a screen or wiggle a Mouse and, "Hey Presto!" We can see
the news or watch a Movie. Some of you may already have some insight as
to how this all works, but Dr Stallard's in depth knowledge and
experience gave a unique opportunity to think of what happens behind our
screens.

We are so fortunate that Paul volunteered to be our Software Architect;
taking charge of our media coverage, and creating the Science at
Fishbourne website for us. An added bonus for us, and particularly for
me: he has put his slides on the website. This means you won't be
subjected to my limited understanding of maths, as I write my review.

Numbers play an essential role in the creation and the streaming of
video content, with hundreds of millions of users of this technology,
thousands of computers run these systems, with Netflix employing 2000
software engineers.

So how does it all work? Paul explained that when we see a row of boxes
each showing an image of the different videos available to watch on our
screens, we are looking a: "Rail" of "Tiles."

He explained the resolution of HD TV (1920x1080 pixels) so giving a
clear picture on our screens of varying sizes; the use of the 3 colours:
red, green and blue, each having 8 bits of data with 24 bits for each
pixel.

We typically have broadband speeds to our homes of tens, or if we're
lucky 100s, of megabits per second. A megabit per second is a million
bits (a 1 or a 0) per second. HD video requires 2.5 gigabits per second
(2.5 billion bits per second) and Ultra HD needs 10 gigabits per second.
Even "standard definition", video equivalent to the old analogue signal,
needs 250 megabits per second.  To send these streams to people's
houses, the video has to be squashed (compressed) down to fit in the
available bandwidth.

Sending large chunks of information consumes time and energy, so
reducing the sequence and chunks of data is managed by allocating
numbers for each colour. The colours are each assigned their identifying
number, followed by a number to indicate how many pixels of that colour
there are before a colour change. Paul gave this as an example: By using
numbers such as 4,1 to indicate 1 blue pixel, the bitrate is reduced.
This is called run-length encoding. You can find out more here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding>

To reduce the bitrate further, only the difference between one image and
the next need be thought of; all instructions for the pixels remain the
same if the background scene hasn't changed; just instructions for the
added/altered part of the image are manipulated. Paul explained this
very well using Lego blocks.

Taking it one step further; if the image has, for example: grass, then
several pixels in a chunk might be encoded by number and used as a
repeat, so reducing the bitrate even more. This, considers how the
viewer is drawn to the main action/subject, so making exact detail on
grass or sky, or other parts of the scene, less important to the viewer.

Sometimes we might experience distortion or even a complete breakdown of
an image/video we are viewing. Just one error can bring this about.
Digital images, being sent in these blocks of information, causes
distortion to appear in the form of blocks. This is because data is
received by our devices which then rebuild the images, and any
interference will disrupt the data.

Having so many different devices and bandwidths, Netflix, creates 120
versions/encodings of each movie. As we watch our TV screen, we aren't
aware of the constant communication between TV and server. The TV
requests the manifest and the server responds by sending a version
compatible with the current bandwidth. This is termed an "Adaptive
Bitrate." All Video streams use this.

I expect we've all experience latency: someone moves to another room and
turns on a streaming device, tuning into a programme you are watching
and you hear, again, words already spoken on screen where you are. This
is because of, "Buffering." As time is involved in transmission, there
will always be a delay in receiving data. To ensure there are no empty
gaps in transmission, buffering works by stepping back by 3 ten second
blocks of data, so creating latency of 30 seconds but ensuring no empty
gaps.

Imagine the scene if the entire country all shopped for food in exactly
the same store in Chichester.

A similar scenario may be imagined when we realise that the highest
number of users recorded for one live stream was 65 million! Paul
explained how this works: There are many massive data centres, each
holding racks and racks of computers and there are companies who work
specifically in this field of content delivery such as Cloud Fare and
Akamai. There are also caches of data on servers all around the country,
which connect to the data centres in order to collect data. These
systems and data must be available for 99.999% of the time, so being
offline for 5 minutes in a year. The videos we each watch will have been
sourced from our nearest cache location.

1000 servers may have 3 failures a day, but as all systems are
duplicated and constantly checked and tested. Any new software is set to
run alongside the old before any change is decided. There is even a
system of, "Chaos Engineering," which seeks to introduce failures, so
ensuring ways of overcoming them.

What do we give to this system in order to receive our entertainment?
Well, Netflix collects 500 billion events from our devices every day;
information about us and our viewing. Collecting data is very costly,
highlighting the value to companies such as Netflix; they wouldn't
collect data if there was no substantial gain.

This data is used for such things as:

business reporting;

fault detection;

app personalisation and recommendations;

marketing;

targeted ads;

content performance and A/B surveys.

Even the Rails and Tiles we see, when searching for something to watch,
have been ordered and suggested for each of us personally. A different
image from a movie may be shown to each individual, knowing their
interests and preferences.

Netflix collects this data, in part, to decide what shows to make. It
even randomly distributes, different ideas to different people. One
person might see idea A and another may see idea B, decisions are then
made on which is more successful.

So, what of the future? It seems that anything is possible and what is
possible will no doubt happen!

Interactivity is already with us, particularly for sport which is very
lucrative for the industry. Viewers can decide which camera angle gives
the best shot of a player. They can even view as if positioned in a
particular location in a sports stadium.

Ideas for what is to come, depend on innovation and technological
advancements (and I note that Innovation is now added as a component of
many university degree courses). It may be that each of us could choose
to play the part of the hero in a movie.

It is already possible to, perfectly dub sound: different words, even
languages can be engineered into a movie seamlessly. Paul showed a clip
from a movie which had an R rating because of one word. Instead of re-
shooting a scene, the sound and lip movement data was altered while
managing to keep the actor's voice, so enabling a better rating and less
restricted viewing of the movie.

I hope you all enjoyed Paul's talk as much as I did. We now have a
doorway into understanding the magic that enters our homes, and an
awareness of the practical use of data and innovation, together with an
understanding of how valuable our personal data is to a wide range of
industries.

We touched on the impact of data centres on the environment and the need
for alternative solutions to the use of water for cooling the hardware.
We didn't discuss the rise of A I and its possible positive and negative
impact on our world. Hopefully students of innovation will help to
provide answers we need in the future.
