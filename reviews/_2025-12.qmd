Many of us may have received manipulated video clips instead of
Christmas and New year cards this year, so the pace of change, and the
power and versatility of computing is evident. Tony's presentation gave
some background history to the changes we experience almost daily, and
there was much discussion on what the future might hold.

Neils Bohr was Tony's starting point with a quote attributed to him:

*"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's to do with the
future."*

Further quotes from the presentation showed how wrong some predictions
can be. Sometime in 1943, Thomas Watson -the chair of IBM- massively
underestimated the future of computers when he suggested: *"There is a
world market for maybe 5 computers."*

The word: computer originally described a person who drew up a calendar.
Today we understand computers to be very different, so how did it all
begin and where might we be heading?

Maybe it all began with Herman Hollerith, who in the 1880s, developed
his revolutionary
electromechanical punch card system for statistics. It was based on the
French Jaquard textile loom and contained one row of code. His
"Tabulating Machine Company," eventually became **I**nternational
**B**usiness **M**achines in 1924.

Early computers used gears and levers; an example is Charles Babbage\'s
Analytical Engine. Although it was never fully built, it paved the way
for progress.

War and conflict can drive progress. Creativity and innovation are vital
when considering how to defend a country, and finance is given to the
military during these times for the creation of new devices to assist in
defence. The 2^nd^ World War saw the invention of the vacuum tube and a
shift from mechanical to electronic computing which was faster and more
reliable. Colossus was the first programmable electronic computer, built
and used at Bletchley Park to break a complex German cipher. It was
designed by Tommy Flowers and it used 2½ thousand vacuum tubes.

The ENIAC computer was built at Pennsylvania University and was the
first programmable general purpose computer; not one for the home though
as it weighed 30 tons and used 17,468 vacuum tubes! The mean time before
failure of the system was 1½ hours.

The Mechanic Magazine at least realised that the size of computers would
reduce when this prediction was published: *"Computers in the future may
weigh no more than 1½ tons."*

Between 1956 and 1963, transistors replaced vacuum tubes and computers
became smaller and more reliable. IBM's 1401 computer weighed only 5
tons and was roughly the size of two refrigerators. Over half the
world's computers were 1401s by the mid 1960s. It processed from punched
cards and used magnetic tape for storage and retrieval. Payroll,
inventories and billing could all be processed on this computer. Since
then computers have continued to advance and progress. IBM's 7090 cost 3
million dollars and could be rented by the month.

From transistors we move to integrated circuits. Seymour Cray, in 1964
introduced the CDC 6600. This used silicon transistors and 10 small
processors rather than one system. This was deemed a super computer
working at speeds faster than its rivals at IBM. It cost 24 million
dollars. He soon improved on this with the CDC 7600, which ran at 5
times the speed of the CDC 6600. To this he pipelined the units so that
instructions for calculations could be fed in, without waiting for the
last calculation to finish. Function units could work in parallel and
there was no queueing to input instructions. Dr Mobbs had experience of
working with one of these machines, which being 6ft X 10ft he likened to
a deity surrounded by men in white coats with offerings.

There are now many computer languages to learn, but FORTRAN70 was used
then and is still in use today.

1981 saw the advent of Personal Computers with IBM's Model 5150 which
cost just over 1½ thousand dollars. The operating system was Microsoft's
MS-DOS (I remember going to evening classes to learn how to use MS-DOS).
There was a floppy disc drive and 64K of memory. This development
spurred the, now dominant software and hardware industries associated
with computing.

Acorn Computers built the BBC Micro -computer, as part of the BBC's
literacy programme. Most schools in the country had one. They cost from
£299 and had a notable impact on education and on the UK's home-grown
software industry.

In 1984, Amstrad launched a home computer, the CPC 464 It cost from £249
and 3 million were sold over its lifetime.

In the 1980s the Apple Corporation worked on the Lisa project: a
computer with a drop down menu bar; windows; a file system; a copy and
paste function; folders, and a mouse. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple
was forced out of the project. He took up Jef Raskin's Macintosh project
and sales of the Apple Macintosh computer surpassed those of Apple's
Lisa.

Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, after
working on, what was considered to be, the first commercially successful
personal computer: the Altair 8800 computer. This was produced by Ed
Roberts' company **M**icro **I**nstrumentation and **T**elemetry
**S**ystems. MITS suffered from cash flow problems and the brand
disappeared.

Microsoft launched their Windows 1.0 in November 1985 and this led to
Windows being the most popular desktop operating system in the world.

Vannevar Bush in 1945 wrote about the underlying idea of creating and
following trails of information on microfilm, and in 1989 Tim
Berners-Lee created the first **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb pages. The
**WWW** is the system used for the implementation of Hypertext (a term
first mooted by Ted Nelson in 1963). Hypertext is the concept of
allowing links between documents, as suggested by Vannevar Bush, and the
WWW provides the infrastructure of clickable links enabling jumps from
one document to another.

The shape and evolution of the WWW was standardised in 1994. Mosaic, was
the first user friendly web browser in 1993. It made the internet
accessible and led to the Dot Com Revolution and Boom, between 1995 and
2000.

The first commercially available mobile phone was released by Motorola
in 1984. It cost \$4,000, gave 30 minutes of talk time and took 10 hours
to charge.

Apple's first Smartphone arrived in 2007. It combined a phone, an ipod
and an internet device with a touch screen. The latest iPhone 17
(launched in September 2025) it has a **L**ight **D**etection and
**R**anging **S**canner so enabling in depth maps and better auto focus
on the camera, together with better low light photography. 30,000
invisible dots are used to make a map of your face (face ID can be used
to open your iphone).

Transistors have been getting smaller and smaller. They now measure on
the atomic scale at 3 nanometres wide; DNA is 2.5 nanometres wide.
Further shrinking would be either too expensive or become impossible.

The speed of computing has also increased; the first commercial systems
measured performance in thousands of operations per second (FLOPS),
whereas modern personal devices operate at trillions of operations per
second (teraFLOPS) or even higher. 

We are now heading towards autonomous cars becoming widespread and the
5^th^ generation of computing: Synthetic Intelligence: autonomous,
emergent thinking systems. We now have AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini,
Claude, Copilot and Grok. There is, and will be, great social impact
with potentially 100,000 jobs lost, even those of university graduates.
Robotics are used not only in such industries as car manufacturing but
also in military applications - 70% of the **D**efence **A**dvanced
**R**esearch **P**rojects **A**gency's programmes have made use of
Robotics and machine learning.

Currently, China, USA, Canada and Tesla take the lead in the manufacture
of Humanoid robots.

Where do we head next? We return to Tony's heading for this talk:
"Predicting the future can be difficult". Let's hope for the
continuation of humanity and creativity, with a foundation of love not
fear.

Happy New Year to all at Science at Fishbourne!
