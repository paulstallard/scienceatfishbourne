Last year Kevin gave us detailed information on Elekta MRI Radiotherapy
units, and this week, his presentation was based on his own experience
of installing a heat pump; a project which may directly affect us all in
our homes if we are considering replacing our heating systems. Energy
costs continue to rise, and so many new advances and changes are on the
horizon that it's good to receive such well researched information.

Fortunately, Kevin has provided us with his slides, and also with
information from a blog called, 'Protons for Breakfast.' (both linked above)

I need only summarise some of the important points:

Gas and electric heating will give out energy equal to that which is put
in to run the system. A heat pump will provide more heat than the energy
put in. This ratio is the CoP and Kevin showed a CoP of 4, i.e. 4kw of
heat into the home, from an input of 1kw to run the heat pump. Together
with the right tariff this makes a heat pump much cheaper to run than
gas.

It's important to set the Flow Temperature correctly to maximise
efficiency; set it too cool and the house isn't warm, and set it too
hot, then efficiency is compromised.

Good insulation is one of the best investments you can make, it not only
reduces the amount of heat that you need but it also makes a heat pump
more efficient.

A British company called; Homely (<https://www.homelyenergy.com/>) have
developed a heat pump micro controller that automatically maximises all
aspects of heat production and cost efficiency. Kevin became an
installer in order to fit one to his heat pump, and I note that the web
site invites you to train to be an installer too! This system, in
seeking to use energy when it's cheaper, may produce more heat
sometimes, but this evens out to ensure constant warmth.

Underfloor heating and a large water tank are recommended. If water in
the tank is kept at just at the right temperature for showering (45°C is
efficient) a 250L tank will be useful.

Radiators work fine with a heat pump, and larger radiators are best,
Kevin kept all but two of his original radiators, which he replaced with
larger ones to gain the heat required.

Of the more than 190 million heat pumps installed globally around 94%
are Air source and 6% are Ground source.

Of note: In Norway 95% of all replaced units are heat pumps, wheras in
the UK only 8% of homes use heat pumps, this may be due to negative
media coverage. There are government grants for heat pumps at the moment
giving £7,500.

A thermal survey camera is a useful device when installing insulation:
Heat the house, then turn off the heating and use the camera to find the
cool spots.

Solar panels are also a useful addition, particularly in the Summer
(south facing would be best). Kevin is not in favour of battery storage
and just sells his surplus energy back to the grid. His average monthly
Octopus charge is £69.

Payback on the installation of batteries would take between 7 and 10
years and batteries generally only have a useful life of around 10
years.

Environmentally, the use of lithium batteries is damaging to the
countries who mine for it: Australia, Chile and China. The mining causes
pollution in the water, and the air; it also causes degradation of the
land; of the soil and vegetation. Mining produces large quantities of
mineral waste and disrupts habitats.

We also know, from a previous presentation, that lithium isn't easily
extracted and recycled. Dumping lithium batteries would be lethal to the
land. The batteries are also highly flammable.

Sodium ion batteries may be with us in the future, and they (according
to my internet search): *"Have the potential to be more environmentally
friendly than lithium-ion batteries. However, the environmental impact
depends on a number of factors, including production, recycling, and the
end-of-life of the battery." *

Research is also taking place into a solid- state electrolyte and if
this is successful, It's hoped that this ceramic battery might usefully
be used in medical devices.

Hydrogen, if it replaces gas for heating a home, may cost 6 -- 7 times
as much as using a heat pump.

I've attempted to give the main points, but please now see the 2
