Dr Ian Goodall, last presented to us in January 2024 on Genetic
Fingerprinting. This month, his talk was equally informative; a subject
on which we have all had first- hand experience in one way or another.
Ian, a biology teacher, has also held the position of Head Teacher at
Yateley School (the largest secondary school in north east Hampshire.

My review covers an outline of Ian's talk with a few extra bits of
information discovered on the internet, together with links to articles
and documents which may be of interest for discussion.

Ian introduced the story of vaccines by reflecting on past diseases such
as the bubonic plague/black death, from which, estimates suggest, a
possible 50% of Europe's population died in the 14^th^ Century.

Possible factors for greater illness/disease at this time were: poor
diet, poor sanitation, a prevalence of parasites and crowded living
conditions.

Ian also mentioned tuberculosis which, evidence suggests, has existed
for thousands of years. It continues to present a global health problem,
and has possibly killed a billion people.

Smallpox, of which traces have been found in Egyptian tombs, spread
through trade routes; crusades and the movement of settlers and
explorers. Generally, around a third of those who contracted the
disease, died, a third were left with terrible scaring and a third
survived with no real ill effect.

[Live Vaccination]{.underline}

**Lady Mary Wortley Montagu**, a writer and a poet, suffered scaring
after contracting smallpox. She lived in Constantinople for some time,
when her husband was appointed ambassador to turkey and there she
witnessed how women practised "engraftment": taking a sample of pus from
someone afflicted with smallpox and applying it to wounds on the wrists
and ankles of volunteers, so introducing the pus into their
bloodstreams. Smallpox in Turkey, had become less virulent because of
this.

Variolation or vaccination, began to be widely used in England in 1721.

Methods of vaccination were:

-   placing smallpox material onto scratched skin;

-   blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the nose of the recipient

-   inoculation by introducing smallpox material into the skin with a
    needle.

**Edward Jenner** 1749-1823 would have been variolated before going to
school. He became a GP in Gloucestershire and has been revered for
eradicating smallpox by using cowpox (for more discussion on this see
the link below). Observing that milk-maids who contracted cowpox were
protected from smallpox, Jenner scratched cowpox, taken from Sarah
Nelmes, a dairymaid, onto a young orphan boy called James Phipps. James
then received two inoculations with smallpox several months apart and
suffered no ill effect.

It was also observed that a vaccination with cow pox could cause cow pox
transmission, so spreading immunity from smallpox. James Phipps received
reward, for his part in the experiment, in the form of a cottage for his
lifetime.

Dr Goodall referred to the start of movements against vaccination. In
researching the beginnings of anti- vaccination leagues, I discovered
the following: (to read more, use the link at the end)

The smallpox vaccination was made statutory for all new born children in
1853 and between 1864 and 1868, during a mild epidemic, enforcement of
vaccination became rigid, with penalities for not complying. After
reports of serious and also fatal side effects, an anti-vaccination
league began, chiefly in Leicester; however stricter measures were
introduced in 1871 leading to 6000 prosecutions in Leicester alone.

The last natural case of smallpox was in 1977 in Somalia, and the last
case, was Janet Parker a medical photographer who worked at the
Birmingham medical school, which housed a smallpox laboratory.

**Louis Pasteur**, discovered pasteurisation (the heat treatment of
foods). He believed in germ theory; the activity of microorganisms being
responsible for disease. His investigations into cholera amongst
chickens led to his discovery of how to make vaccines by attenuating, or
weakening, the microbe involved. His continued research led to vaccines
for Anthrax and rabies. His first human patient, for the rabies vaccine,
was Joseph Meister, a nine-year-old boy who would otherwise have died.
He lived to tell the tale.

Pasteur also speculated on ways in which the body can rid itself of
foreign matter, and supported the view that phagocytes are agents of
immunity.

**[Other Notable Figures from the past:]{.underline}**

During a cholera outbreak in 1854, a physician, **John Snow** mapped the
area of Soho and famously identified a specific water pump as the source
of the disease, leading to the removal of the pump's handle and, as a
result, a significant reduction in the spread of infection. 

**Ignaz Semmelweis, a C19th Hungarian physician was described as: "The
saviour of mothers and the father of infection control," when he**
discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically
cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. He
thoroughly investigated possible causes and reached the conclusion
that medical students carried "cadaverous particles" on their hands from
the autopsy room to the patients they examined. He instituted a policy
of using a solution of chlorinated lime for hand washing, and the death
rate dropped.

**Joseph Lister**, inspired by Louis Pasteur's germ theory, applied it
to surgery. He experimented with carbolic acid (phenol) as an
antiseptic, using it to clean wounds, instruments, and the operating
room air. His antiseptic methods dramatically reduced post-operative
infection and mortality rates, and his Antisepsis System forms the basis
of modern infection-control.

**Polioviruses:** Paralytic polio affects 0.1% - 0.2% of infected,
symptomatic people. Paul Alexander, who developed this form of polio
survived in an iron lung machine for 71 years. Franklin Roosevelt, the
32^nd^ president of the USA, was diagnosed with polio in 1921, at the
age of 39. He founded the National Centre for Infantile Paralysis,
asking people to give a dime to fund research into polio (The March of
Dimes).

In the 1950s poor sanitation, improper sewage disposal and lack of
access to clean water, together with overcrowding, caused a rise in
polio outbreaks. During this time, the National Centre for Infantile
Paralysis funded the research of **Jonas Salk.** Salk created an
**inactivated vaccine** by using formaldehyde to kill the poliovirus
without destroying its [antigenic]{.underline} properties (the vaccine
can still trigger an immune response).

The **Covid 19 mRNA** vaccine concluded Dr Goodall's talk, and this led
to much discussion, as Covid 19 and all associated with it has so
recently affected the global population in so many ways.

Ian explained how this novel approach worked, it being neither a live
nor inactivated vaccine; instead it could be likened to a computer
algorithm, as it sends instruction via mRNA telling cells how to
manufacture the coronavirus spike protein. Indeed, it was created
(according to Moderna) in 42 days with the help of Artificial
Intelligence.

A simple explanation of how it works: The mRNA introduced into muscle
cells contains a blueprint for the spike protein. Ribosomes follow this
set of instructions, assembling amino acids to form the spike protein.
The immune system recognises this as a foreign body and an immune
response is triggered.

This being a novel approach to triggering an immune response, there has
been much controversy surrounding it, and to the strict global measures
applied and their consequences. Discussion after the presentation,
brought up questions and comments linked to adverse reactions and the
reporting of them. A I, when asked the question, states that under
reporting of adverse events is 90%.
