Ian, biology teacher and previously Head Teacher at Yateley School (the
largest secondary school in north east Hampshire), found no issues of
class behaviour at Science at Fishbourne. We were a captive audience,
and many comments were made that this presentation was at a good level
for the group. I have found many links to websites (below) for further
investigation and information, as so many aspects of DNA were covered in
this presentation.

Here I offer short summaries of each area:

**[Genetic Fingerprinting]{.underline}**

**Alec Jeffreys** discovered the technique of genetic fingerprinting
whilst working in the department of genetics at Leicester University in 1984.

The first crime where this technique was used was in 1986. The police
had arrested a young man with learning difficulties, believing him to be
a serial killer. Using the new technique of DNA fingerprinting, DNA
samples from all men, local to the crimes, who had been born between
1953 and 1970 were collected and tested. No matches were found, and no
match was found with the arrested young man.

A year later, from a chance conversation amongst friends, it was
discovered that the man responsible for the crimes had sent someone else
to impersonate him, when DNA was collected. He was subsequently found
guilty of the crimes and of 1000 further sexual offences. He was sent to
prison for 30 years.

There is now a UK database of 5 million samples of DNA.

**[DNA]{.underline}**

DNA is a robust molecule. Each molecule consists of two long
polynucleotide chains composed of four types of nucleotide sub units.
The base may be either: *adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),* or *thymine (T)*.

The non-coding areas of DNA have repeated letters (combinations of
G,C,A,T) and the position and number of repeats is unique to each
person. 97% of DNA is Non-coding DNA.

A DNA molecule is composed of two DNA strands held together by hydrogen
bonds between the paired bases.

**[The process of DNA profiling]{.underline}**:

-   Enzymes are used to cut up DNA into fragments

-   Fragments are put onto agarose gel

-   Negatively charged DNA migrates through the pores of an agarose gel
    towards the positively charged end of the gel when an electrical
    current is applied, with smaller fragments migrating faster. The
    resulting bands can then be visualized using ultraviolet (UV) light.

-   The resulting bands shown have a 30 billion to one chance of being
    the same as those of another person, except in the case of identical
    twins.

-   The possibilities for uncertainty when using this to discover who
    committed a crime are commented on in **the fifth website link**
    **below.**

**[PCR]{.underline}**

PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a process that can amplify a tiny
sample of DNA in order to read the repeating letter patterns in a DNA
molecule.

DNA samples are treated to break the DNA strands. These are copied in
the process. Repeats of the procedure (cycling) produce more copies: 4
cycles will create 32 copies.

DNA fingerprinting has many uses and Ian explained how this process had
been used to identify the remains of King Richard 3rd, and The Romanovs.
It can also help to solve issues of paternity.

**[History]{.underline}**

In **1869 Frierich Mieschner** discovered DNA without fully realising
the role it played.

In **1944 Oswald Avery** discovered that DNA, rather than proteins,
controls life, (only DNA can convert TB bacteria into a non- lethal
strain, so proving that DNA is a genetic molecule).

**Rosalind Franklin Photograph 51.** In **1952** Rosalind Franklin,
together with her PhD student, Ramond Gosling, exposed DNA to X-rays for
a total of 62 hours and achieved **Photograph 51.** This was shown to
Francis Crick, who was trying to build a 3D model of DNA with James
Watson. They achieved their model in **1953** and were recognised for
the discovery, receiving the **Nobel Prize in 1962**. Only much later
has Rosalind Franklin received merit for her research. She died at the
age of 37, unacknowledged, from ovarian cancer, possible caused by
exposure to X-rays.

**[Epigenetics]{.underline}**

Epigenetics is a way of influencing how our genome is regulated without
the DNA code itself being changed. Epigenetics can determine when genes
are turned on and off (also referred to as gene expression), and which
proteins are produced as a result. It can even control the structure of
the genome.

Most epigenetic modifications are transient and reversible, allowing our
cells to respond and adapt to changes in environment and behaviour.
Although they happen on a molecular level, they can have a considerable
impact on us, and can also be influenced by external factors, such as
diet and lifestyle.

**[Summary of Genetic Fingerprints]{.underline}**

-   These exist in blood, bone, hair follicles, saliva, semen, skin and
    sweat.

-   They are the same in every cell and retain their distinctiveness
    throughout a person\'s life.

-   Human cells contain 23 chromosomes (packets of DNA) from the father
    and 23 from the mother.

-   Each DNA strand contains a unique sequence or code of genetic
    information. But while most of DNA shows only slight variation from
    one person to the next, certain areas, called \'minisatellites\'
    (short sequences of chemical building blocks) show variation in the
    numbers of repeat units (or stutters) unique to each person.

-   DNA information can be recovered from human and animal remains as
    far back as Neanderthal man, and has been used to solve a number of
    high profile mysteries from the past, including the identification
    of Josef Mengele\'s skeleton and the identity of children of US
    President Thomas Jefferson\'s children by one of his slaves.

Apart from identification, paternity and immigration cases, the
technique is also used in medical research including cancer and
genetic conditions such as Huntington\'s disease.
