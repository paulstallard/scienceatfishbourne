This was a subject of great interest to the members of Science at
Fishbourne, as indicated by the number of people who turned up to listen
to Tony, and we weren't disappointed. Quantum is fuzzy so no one was
expecting true enlightenment, but we were all captivated by Tony's talk
and there was much discussion afterwards.

Tony began with some history of the Atom, beginning with a definition of
the word itself, which came from the Greek: Atamos, which means:
**uncuttable**. It was **Democritus 460BCE-370BCE** who noticed how
steps became worn down over time as people walked up and down them. He
realised that friction from footfall was causing particles to rub off
the steps. There must therefore be, **tiny particles**.

Over time, other scientists put forward their theories and discoveries:

-   1803 John Dalton -- matter is made from little balls which form
    elements. Atoms of one element are all alike but they differ from
    atoms of other elements.

-   1897 **JJ Thompson** -- Atoms had charges.

-   1911 **Ernest Rutherford** -- Atoms had a nucleus.

-   1913 **Neils Bohr** -- Electrons go around the nucleus (Nobel prize
    in 1922)

-   1919 **Rutherford** - identified the proton as the fundamental
    particle within the nucleus. The nucleus contains protons, giving it
    a positive charge.

-   1869 **Mendeleev** - He organized known elements by their increasing
    atomic weight and properties, forming the basis for the modern
    periodic table.

In the **20^th^ Century CERN** opened on the French Swiss border. It is
about 100 metres underground and its particle accelerator consists of a
ring tunnel of 27 kilometres. Here atoms are accelerated at super high
speed and their collisions cause particles to fall off. These particles,
in the 1960s were given the name Quarks. Quarks have mass, a fraction of
charge and spin. There are also Leptons. **Quarks and Leptons** are the
two fundamental types of elementary particles that make up all known
matter. They are collectively called **Fermions**.

Other particles: **Bosons**; such as **Gluons** and **Photons** are
force carriers and they mediate the fundamental forces between the
**Fermions**.

In 2012, the Higgs Boson was discovered at the **L**arge **H**adron
**C**ollider at **CERN.** This discovery confirmed the existence of the
Higgs field and its associated mechanism. The **Higgs Boson** is an
excitation of this field and it gives mass to other elementary
particles.

There are also **Neutrinos**. These have no charge and very small mass
and maybe they give some -- as yet unexplained- magic to our lives (my
suggestion), as **tens of trillions** of them, stream from the **Sun**,
passing through our bodies every second.

Tony explained lots more, about protons, neutrons, charges and spins,
but perhaps further reading on this is a good idea.

In the 17^th^ Century Isaac Newton proposed that light consists of tiny
particles called corpuscles and Charles Huygens proposed that light was
a wave. Modern physics recognizes that light is not strictly one or the
other, but exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behaviours
depending on how it is observed or measured.

**Max Plank** in 1900 discovered the **Quantum theory**. He proposed
that the energy from a heated object is not continuous, but comes in
small, discrete units (quanta). This idea solved the problem of black-
body radiation, a phenomenon that classical physics could not
explain. He also introduced the **fundamental** **constant ℎ** to define
the energy of a quantum. This constant is now a cornerstone of quantum
mechanics. 

**Albert Einstein** won the **Nobel Prize in 1922 f**or his discovery of
the law of the photoelectric effect. This explains the relationship
between Electron emission and light frequency. Light consists of small
packets of energy called photons.

**Thomas Young in 1801** demonstrated that light had a wave nature by
conducting the double slit experiment. (see link below).

Other Scientists referenced by Tony, include **Louis de Broglie**; **Max
Born** and **Erwin Schrodinger**.

Unlike classical physics, **Quantum events have inherent probabilistic
outcomes**, and Tony gave some physical examples relating to **Kinetic
and Potential energy.** Holding a length of string, each end being held
in each hand, and one end having a weight attached, he explained that in
this horizontal position, potential energy was displayed. Upon releasing
the end with the weight, Kinetic energy came into play as the weight
swung downwards in an arc.

Probability waves are a concept of Quantum mechanics. The wave like
nature of a particle represents the probability of finding it in a
particular location. Electrons don't move around a nucleus in neat
orbits but move as in a cloud. The probability as to the position of any
one electron; it could be anywhere. When you locate it, then the
probability wave collapses because you know where it is. Schrodinger's
cat thought experiment relates to this concept.

Waves also have preferred patterns depending on the amount of energy in
them and Tony demonstrated possible orbital regions where electrons
might be found around a nucleus, by putting energy into a length of
string.

**A I** gave me these words to attempt to explain Tony's demonstration
of the **S,P,D** **and F orbitals**:

*"Think of them as different \"rooms\" for electrons, each holding a
specific number of electrons: **s** is a single, spherical room (2
electrons); **p** are three dumbbell-shaped rooms at right angles (6
electrons); **d** have a four-leaf clover shape and are more complex (10
electrons); and **f** orbitals have even more complex, varied shapes (14
electrons)."*

**Superposition is a fundamental principle of Quantum Computing**. In
superposition an object can be in more than one quantum state until you
measure it.

**Entanglement is also** **a fundamental principle of Quantum
Computing**. It connects particles that are linked. Entanglement can
happen, over any distance, from a physical collision or from sharing a
common origin. Tony asked us to imagine a pair of gloves. If we place
one in a box and have another on our right hand, we know that the one in
the box is the left hand. The pair are linked even if the box is far
away.

The computers we use at home are **"Classical Computers."** They use
bits to represent data using 0s and 1s. These are like, on /off
switches. For example, to calculate 3 X 5, the numbers are first
converted into binary they are processed through many logic gates and
the answer emerges in a fraction of a second.

**Quantum Computers use qubits**. This is a system that can be in
**superposition** of two different states at the same time: both 0
and 1. They can therefore perform many calculations at the
simultaneously. Their power is boosted by **entangling qubits.** The
quantum particle must be kept, just like a spinning coin, in a coherent
state. Qubits behave in a probabilistic manner. They will run the same
calculation multiple times and return a set of probabilities rather than
a single number.

One of the problems faced is the ability to maintain coherence -- the
freedom from outside interference. Environmental effects such as noise
and vibration will interfere with the Quantum computer.

Classical computers perform the everyday tasks, which we use, very well.
Quantum computers are currently massive: IBM's D Wave computer is 7-8
feet tall. Their use is for breaking modern encryption; simulating
molecular interactions for drug discovery and solving large-scale
optimisation problems such as supply chain logistics. They can solve
complex statistical problems in finance and perform accurate scientific
simulations.

A quantum computer can't be used to send a signal because the outcome of
measurement is probabilistic. you only know how the two measurements
will be related.

I have enjoyed attempting to write this review, and truly enjoyed Tony's
presentation. Now .... So many more questions ...

I hope you find the links below useful too ..
