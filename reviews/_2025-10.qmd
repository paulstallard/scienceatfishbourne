Tony, a member of our group, who has worked as a system engineer,
including Flight Simulation, opened a door into one of his areas of
interest when he made his presentation to Science at Fishbourne this
month. He outlined his research into the big problem of congestion on
our roadways and his idea for a possible solution.

Tony explored the relationship between wealth, transport and
opportunity. The ability to travel quickly (most people prefer a 30
minute commute) brings the higher possibility of employment and social
exchange.

GDP growth rose with the arrival of the car. Access to a car gives twice
as much opportunity for social engagement; four times greater job
opportunity, and it offers a cheaper mode of transport than bus or
train. The lowest income families, without a car, will spend 20% of
their income on transport.

The problem arises when more and more cars appear on the roads; they
account for 75% of all road traffic.

I asked AI how many people were waiting for a driving test at the
moment:

*"At the end of September 2025, [668,128]{.mark} people had a practical
driving test booked in Britain."*

So, more congestion, on our roadways to come, year by year.

As congestion increases, so the speed of traffic slows and the benefit
of the 30 minute speedy commute to work moves further away. Tony's
research pointed to traffic in 2050 moving at the speed of a bicycle,
but he says that the car will still be worth having.

The government have a view to reduce demand, limiting car use by various
means, such as 15 minute cities; congestion charging; building road
barriers to limit car use; financial controls on parking; increasing
lanes for cycle routes and encouraging the use of public transport etc.
These measures will generally continue to predominantly affect those on
low income.

Tony has researched an idea which he believes could offer: door to door
travel; have minimal environmental impact; increase opportunity and be
economically viable and sustainable.

The concept is to build single lane; toll based; Eways. These would be
routed along existing road/rail margins and would consist of elevated
roadways built on a simple colonnade system which would have minimal
land use. There would be on/off junctions in every Parish.

Helical screw piling would enable fast installation and removal and the
track sections would have WPT- wireless power, transferred through
woven, wire cables.

60% of all car journeys are made by just one person and so the Ecar used
on the Eway would be a 2 seater with a short range battery which would
charge on the Eway. It could possibly have pedal assist too. The cost of
such a vehicle could be compared with that of a motor-bike at around
£8000, making it more achievable for those on low income.

Eway ramps for Supermarkets could use Ecargo, autonomous variants.

Energy for the Eway might use LAS -- Liquid Air Storage from Wind Power,
so being completely renewable.

Tony proposes that getting public acceptance would be the first step to
getting his idea off the ground and he recognises that there are many
questions still to ask; more ideas and discussion are needed.

For this reason, he is interested in presenting his idea to University
Students, perhaps as part of their Innovation programme. It would
certainly encourage creative thinking.

Tony proposes beginning with Digital Twins: "*Virtual, dynamic replicas
of physical buildings, bridges, or infrastructure that use real-time
data from sensors and other technologies to monitor, analyse, and
optimize projects."* From there he would hope to progress to trials,
possibly at Goodwood, followed by uptake on the commercial route from
Southampton to Brighton.

Two Eway routes have a possible cost of £100 million compared to road
improvements of £280 million.

I really enjoyed Tony's talk and it stimulated much discussion amongst
us in our coffee break.

Tony is obviously highly creative. I think this gives him the label as
an innovative thinker, and highlights the need for more people with a
passionate interest to look to the future.

On checking the status of innovation in Great Britain online, I got this
response from AI.

"*Great Britain remains a powerhouse of innovative thinking and creative
output, driven by its world-class universities and a robust venture
capital ecosystem. However, it is not the overall leader in global
rankings and must focus on translating its research excellence into
higher productivity and increased patent activity to compete with the
very top innovators." *

Possibly, Tony's end- product may not be reached, or it may be modified
and find uptake, but the initial idea, the communication, research and
spark for future progress, sets new ideas in motion and that is where
innovation happens.
