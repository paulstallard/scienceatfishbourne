How often do we imagine that the constant motion of the molten iron
alloy in the Earth's outer core, driven by convection and the Earth's
rotation, is crucial for our survival, and the survival of all that
exists on our planet? *(Apologies for the length of this review ... I
got carried away. David inspired me to research further.)*

David began his presentation with this dynamic thought. This process of
action is called the Geo-Dynamo.

It creates a powerful magnetic field around the Earth: The
Magnetosphere.

Without the Magnetosphere, charged particles from the Solar Wind and
high-energy particles from beyond our Solar System known as: "Cosmic
Radiation", would strip away Earth's atmosphere, including the ozone
layer, making life as we know it, impossible on planet Earth.

The interaction of the solar winds and our magnetosphere can give
stunning visual displays in the polar regions, known as Aurora Borealis
and some of us were fortunate to see some of these effects as far south
as Sussex this year. The Sun, reaching the solar maximum in its 11 year
cycle, displayed more Coronal Mass Ejections which expanded the Auroral
Ovals, so extending the field of view of the Aurora Borealis as Earth's
magnetic field guided the charged particles towards the Poles.

How often do we even think of magnets; the Earth's polarity; and how it
might affect us? I've seen a red and white striped pole stuck in the
ground, when visiting Father Christmas' toyshop in Oregon USA, but I
don't think David meant that when he explained the wandering, Magnetic
North and South Poles.

The Magnetic North Pole is shifting towards Siberia, currently at a rate
of around 34 miles a year. The Magnetic South pole is relatively more
stable and roughly every 450,000 years the poles reverse!

The Magnetic field lines at the Magnetic poles are almost vertical, they
then loop around from N to S.

The Geographic Poles are largely stationary locations where the Earth's
axis intersects its surface; the North Pole is at 90°N and the South
Pole 90°S.

David told us a little about key figures in history who worked with
magnetic fields and measurements; people such as Carl Friedrich Gauss;
Nikola Tesla, and Pierre Curie, who discovered the critical temperature
at which ferromagnetic materials lose their permanent magnetic
properties.

The temperature at Earth's interior is estimated to be 6000°C. As Iron
loses its magnetic properties at 770°C, Earth cannot act like a bar
magnet, so realising the theory of the Geo-Dynamo process that creates
our Magnetosphere.

The Earth's past magnetic field directions can help to identify the ages
and past locations of rocks through their specific magnetic properties;
this is known as Paleo-magnetism. The discovery of a volcanic ridge in
the centre of the Atlantic Ocean known as the "Global Mid-Ocean Ridge,"
enabled scientists to map odd magnetic variations in the volcanic rock,
so also giving information about magnetic North South reversals.

**[Ferromagnets]{.underline}**

Iron is a Ferromagnet. It has 26 electrons with spin; each behaving like
a magnet and, in pairs, cancelling each other out. It has 4 un-paired
electrons. These will line up to create atomic magnets. The alignment of
individual atoms, when interacting with neighbouring atoms, produces
magnetic domains. These magnetic domains, being randomly oriented,
produce a magnetic field of almost zero, but iron, once exposed to an
external magnetic field, becomes strongly magnetic as the domains align,
and retains this property even after the external magnetic field is
removed. Other Ferromagnets are: nickel, cobalt and gadolinium.

**[Paramagnets]{.underline}**

Paramagnetic materials react to external magnetic fields but don't
retain strong magnetic properties once the external source is removed.
Some examples are: aluminium, oxygen (O2), titanium, iron oxide (FeO),
magnesium, molybdenum, and various transition metal complexes like
myoglobin.

**[Diamagnets]{.underline}**

Diamagnets don't have any permanent magnetic moments. When placed in an
electronic field, they weakly repel the field, resulting in a small
negative magnetic susceptibility. Some examples of diamagnets are:
copper, nitrogen and barium sulphate. Most body tissues are diamagnetic;
tissues containing iron-based proteins or metal implants will exhibit
other characteristics.

**[Magnetite]{.underline}**

A Lodestone is a naturally magnetised piece of the mineral Magnetite.
Magnetite was used in the Han Dynasty to create a South pointing ladle.
It would be placed on a cast bronze plate, carved with auspicious
trigrams and directions, for use in Feng Shui and Geomancy. Later, it
was used for navigation.

**[Rare Earths]{.underline}**

Today rare earth materials such as Neodymium and Samarium are used to
make strong magnets. Neodymium magnets enabled the miniaturisation of
electronic devices such as mobile phones. They are stronger, permanent
magnets than Samarium Cobalt magnets, whereas they can't operate in such
high temperatures. Samarium Cobalt magnets are more expensive, but their
high-temperature stability and corrosion resistance make them better for
use in aerospace, generators and motors. They aren't recommended where
high impact is required, being more brittle.

Ferrofluid magnets are used in conjunction with Neodymium magnets. They
have friction reducing capabilities when applied to the surface of
Neodymium.

A simple electromagnetic motor (after Michael Faraday's discoveries) is
a homopolar motor and a link below gives detail. Fleming's Left and
Right Hand Rules can be used to show the direction of: the magnetic
field, current and force and details are in the link below.

**[Modern Uses of Magnets]{.underline}**

There are many modern uses for magnets and these include: recycling
systems; Food product decontamination to remove any metals; MRI
scanners; maglev trains; concrete shuttering with magnetic clamps;
trans-cranial stimulation; Degaussing of ships (details in link below);
shark repellent and surgical tools to locate shrapnel.

**[Galactic Magnets and Magnetic Fields]{.underline}**

Theoretical models are still developing to understand these galactic
fields which pervade the Universe, including our Solar System. The
Dynamo mechanism is thought responsible.

It's thought that Magnetic fields can influence phenomena like the
formation of spiral arms and galactic outflows; they perhaps have the
potential to affect the overall evolution of galaxies. 

Many interesting questions followed David's talk and the Bermuda
Triangle was mentioned. There was some discussion, and David mentioned
that there are variations in the Earth's field. It isn't the same
everywhere.

I found this on the internet: The Earth's Magnetic field varies,
particularly over the South Atlantic Ocean. Here Van Allen's radiation
belt dips closest to Earth's surface because of a localised weakness of
the earth's magnetic field. This can cause electronic equipment in
spacecraft to behave unpredictably.

Whilst writing this, I also discovered that our brains contain Magnetite
and I found this on Wikipedia:

"*Some researchers also suggest that humans possess a magnetic
sense,[^\[66\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite#cite_note-Human_magnetoreception-66) proposing
that this could allow certain people to use magnetoreception for
navigation.[^\[67\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite#cite_note-human_magnetoreception-67) The
role of magnetite in the brain is still not well understood, and there
has been a general lag in applying more modern, interdisciplinary
techniques to the study of
biomagnetism.^[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite#cite_note-PMID_20071390-68)"^*
