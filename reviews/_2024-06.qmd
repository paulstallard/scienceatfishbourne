I will be as amazed as you, if I manage to write up a simple review of
today's talk by: Dr James Kinross FRCS PhD, Colorectal Surgeon and
Consultant Surgeon at Imperial College London.

My brain is ready to explode! What a joy to have a specialist with so
much knowledge at his finger-tips to impart!

There is no way that I can give every detail, as James practically told
us the contents of his book:
**"DARK MATTER."** I can, instead, recommend it as a good read and write
about what his talk, and his book, meant to me...

Place yourself high up in space. Look down upon planet Earth and reflect
upon its biosphere, everything is connected; everything is communicating
and everything plays its part in maintaining the balance required to
sustain life. Of all these entities, on Planet Earth, the most numerous
are the **microbes**; there are twenty-three billion tons of bacteria
under the ground alone, and two thousand species of bacteria have been
described in the human gut, where one hundred trillion bacteria reside
at any one time, (roughly equivalent to the same number of cells that
make us human) and these, at last, are being recognised. They are
neither good nor bad. They respond to the treatment they receive. If
treated well, they will do us good, and if neglected or mistreated, we,
our fragile biosphere, will become ill. Just as Dark Matter in the
Universe holds everything together and Dark Energy appears to pull it
apart. It works because of balance.

In the 1900s pathogens were our enemy, causing such things as pneumonia,
cholera and tuberculosis. Mental health problems were minimal and cancer
may have presented in old age.

Today, we are blighted by non-infectious disease such as: cancer,
cardiovascular conditions, obesity, diabetes, allergies, and also mental
health issues.

James explains that our gut microbes, which work symbiotically within
us, have been placed under stress, so leading to an epidemic of
non-infectious diseases. ***Helicobactor** **pylori*** is a case in
point. It has been around in the gut for at least 58,000 years, and it
can offer some protection from infection and may play a part in
controlling hunger. Maternal ***Pylori*** also protects against asthma
in the offspring, but in a gut where the microbes present are under
stress, it can cause ulcers and cancers.

It was **Barry Marshall** who helped open a new chapter on microbiome
research. He and his associate **Robin Warren** believed that gastric
ulcers were not caused by acidity in the stomach. **Barry**, who grew up
in a household open to experimentation, consumed two petri dishes of the
bacteria to prove their theory, that ***Pylori*,** present in the
gut**,** could cause disease, and fourteen days later he developed
gastritis. Scientists now became more interested in this concept, and a
new field of research on the role of microbes began.

Antibiotics are used to wipe out ***Pylori*** in patients who have
gastric ulcers, and since the early 1900s there has been a decline in
the presence of this microbe. Today, just half of the global population
carries ***H. pylori***. It is also, resistant to many antibiotics.
Attempting to wipe it out may have been the only option, but now balance
in the microbiome of the gut is coming into consideration. Any drug
which disturbs the status of the gut will lead to stress amongst the
microbes within it.

James likened our microbial composition to the rainforest or the coral
reef, where the clown fish nestle in symbiosis with the sea anemone, and
the various species living in these habitats keep each other in check.
***Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*,** lives within the tentacle like villi
in the gut, nourishing the gut and maintaining its health. It's able to
camouflage itself so that it can't be confused with a pathogen. This
relationship is so important to our survival, that it has been encoded
into our DNA.

Diversity is threatened when rainforest habitats are chopped down or
pollution enters the sea. In the same way, we need diversity in our gut
to keep the microbes in check. These microbes consist of: viruses,
bacteria, fungi, phage, archaea, helminths and protozoa and they form
the dynamic communities of human microbiomes. When kept in check there
is balance. Destroying one form or another can have the same impact as
polluting the seas or chopping down rainforests. Diet, lifestyle,
environment and medication, (particularly, but not solely antibiotics)
will all impact this diversity.

Although 23,000 genes code us, at a genetic level we are only about 1%
human; the other 99% comprise of genes from the microbes within and upon
us. The microbiome evolves with us, responding to environmental changes.
A new-born baby needs to receive symbiotic bacteria for its future
health, and the process of birth and the giving of mother's milk and
nursing are what create this. Ill health or the giving of antibiotics at
this stage can decimate ecosystems from which the gut may not recover.
The maternal microbiome is also important for the foetus. The
consequences of disrupting the microbiome during pregnancy is
significant. The mother is the conductor of this orchestra of microbes
through her diet, lifestyle and biological functions --some of which may
be beyond her control.

Microbial diversity is changing and appears to be in decline throughout
the biosphere. We have lost 30%-40% of our microbiome over the years and
have maybe gained more microbes which cause imbalance.

There is an interaction between gut and brain. Bacteria shape our
sensitivity to pain in a sex dependent way. Women are programmed to
experience pain differently, they are also more likely to experience
irritable bowel syndrome. Gut microbes can communicate with the brain
through the manufacture of neurotransmitters like serotonin which
affects mood, sleep, appetite and cognitive functions; through hormones
in the endocrine system, and through the immune system. The gut and the
brain grow together and disruptions to the microbiome will impact brain
development.

A microbiome is a community of microorganisms found living together, and
one exists in every area of our body, not just in our gut. Our oral
microbiome has changed as our diet has changed. Since we began farming
and consuming cereal grains, ***Streptococcus mutans*** began to
dominate the oral microbiome and we developed dental caries and dental
plaque. Toothpaste, fluoride and fillings have also had an impact on the
oral microbiome, and its diversity has decreased. One bacterium which
has responded to the western diet: ***Fusobacterium nucleatum,*** is
commonly found in cancers throughout the body.

A ***Bacteriophage*** is a virus, and there are probably 100 million
species in existence. It is used in Russia to replace antibiotics. It is
now being considered for use more widely, as antibiotic resistance
increases. An example is in the case of ***Bacterium Euterococcus,***
found in the microbiome of alcoholics. This bacterium, produces a toxin
which damages the liver, causing *alcoholic hepatitis.* Transplanting
faeces from alcoholics into *germ-free mice,* will produce ***phage***
to target ***Bacterium Enterococcus.***

When administered to the patient, the ***phage*** invades the bacteria
and kills or inactivates it. ***Phage*** treatment is individualised, as
different ***phage*** affect different bacteria.

***Faecal microbiota transplant*** is a novel treatment, faeces from
healthy donors, show positive effect in a number of conditions, such as:
addiction, allergies and chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. In
the future, it will become a precision therapy, and maybe we will be
storing our own microbiomes in times of health, for use at times of
disease.

I'm sure that I've become carried away now. I've found this all so
interesting that I could add everything from James' book. I'll end by
summing up his notes on diet, remembering that eating plastic shouldn't
be part of it, but nevertheless, frighteningly, we generally consume a
credit card sized amount of plastic each month:

We live in a society full of nutritional extremes, and we don't fully
understand how food relates to/can cause disease, but an emphasis on the
consumption of vegetables, legumes, beans, nuts, seeds, fruit, oils,
wholegrains, with small or moderate amounts of meat, fish, eggs, dairy
and red wine (more of that-in moderation- rather than fizzy drinks) is
currently suggested.

Moderation appears to be the key, together with the social enjoyment of
sharing home-cooking. When asked about pro and prebiotics, James thinks
that an individualised approach, when prescribed, is the answer, but
failing that, Kefir may be useful; although exercise and a balanced diet
work well together, to care for your gut and gut-brain.

*P.s from me... Of course many outside influences, which appear to be
beyond our control are also affecting our microbiomes. We can only do
our best, but I've become the typical characterisation of an older
person who writes letters to attempt to influence change that I consider
to be detrimental to the future of our biosphere.*
