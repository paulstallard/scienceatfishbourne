Kevin Brown, MBE, CPhys, FlnstP was Science at Fishbourne's speaker
on the 22^nd^ April. How lucky we are that he joined our group in January!

Kevin's presentation on MRI guided Radiotherapy reminded us that
innovation, passion and dedication are alive and well in England.
Particularly in Crawley, where Elekta are in the business of
manufacturing Radiotherapy units. They are the world's second largest
maker and exporter, delivering to China and the USA.

Kevin's position was clear, from his excellent presentation, and his
obvious understanding, and demonstration of his desire, to constantly
improve upon the MR-Linac unit, of which he has been a part since its
inception. His award of the MBE for services to radiotherapy is
evidently well deserved.

There is lots of information on the internet, where you can explore in
more detail, and I add some links below. Here, I attempt to summarise
the main points from Kevin's talk.

**[Current Cancer Treatment]{.underline}**

There are many predictions and statistics with regards to cancer. I
found this on the Cancer Research website: "Nearly 1 in 2 people born in
the UK in 1961 will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their
lifetime."

Currently, treatment for cancer involves, surgery, drugs (chemotherapy
and immunotherapy) and radiotherapy. Surgery is local therapy, drugs are
systemic, going through the whole body and External Beam Radiotherapy,
also a local therapy, where radiation is delivered from outside the
patient.

Since around 2005, the management of uncertainty in external beam
radiotherapy, is by way of a CT scan. The aim is to target just the
cancer wherever it is in the body. The CT scan can give a picture of
where a tumor is, then the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) can be
determined and a Dose Cloud of radiotherapy administered, so aiming at
the tumor, with as little healthy tissue as possible being targeted.
Over time, the size of the Dose Cloud has become smaller and less
healthy tissue has been affected.

**[Elekta Unity Potential]{.underline}**

The development of the Elekta Unity MR-Linac brings the ability to
clearly see a tumor in real time, by using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A
CT scan can acquire a 3D image of the body whereas an MR can show either
a 3D data set or continuously acquire a single slice.

The MR has a very strong magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla. The gradient
magnet applies a linear change to modify the spin of protons in the
body. A radio frequency matched to that of the protons is applied to the
target location. The protons line up to the magnet, and the RF pulse
they emit as they decay back to their equilibrium state is detected. The
timing of the gradient and RF pulses determine what is seen. Quantum
spin plays its part here; protons are in hydrogen in water. Hydrogen has
a spin of ½ and interacts with electromagnetic fields. Understanding
spin is a whole different story! The main point is that MR has a vivid
visual impact. It can also be used in real time cine acquisition, so
tracking a moving target. I have added a YouTube video explaining MRI
below.

The Unity MR-Linac now opens the possibility of knowing exactly the
location, shape, size of a tumor each time a patient needs treatment.
This means that a more individual, exact way of targeting and dosing can
occur. Using a CT scan to locate a tumor, the target area may be marked
with small tattoos or metal clips or seeds (fiducial markers), may also
be placed inside the body. The patient is then carefully positioned to
target the marked area for each treatment. The MR, on the other hand,
can give an accurate real-time picture of the daily changes in size and
location of a tumor, so enabling more accurate dosing and (in trials)
higher doses directly into a tumor with good results so far. The dosing
and targeting can therefore be adjusted daily. The ability to target
tumors more accurately, may also lead to the need for fewer treatments
(for example: 35 visits could potentially be reduced to 2-5 visits) and
perhaps eradicate the need for surgery or drug therapy, therefore also
reducing side effects.

A team of physicists in the Netherlands pioneered this new technology. A
Linear Accelerator was combined with an MR. The magnet used is 30,000
times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Once a current is introduced
into the superconducting coil and it continues indefinitely therefore no
electrical power is needed. The coil is cooled by liquid Helium (about
4K) to make it superconducting.

To prevent the very strong magnet preventing the Linac from working it
uses 'self-shielding' to create a very low magnetic field where the
Linac is.

A beam of X rays provides the treatment, and it is characterized by the
energy of electrons used to generate it, in this case about 6 million
electron volts of energy. The electrons gain their energy by a Linear
Accelerator or 'Linac' which has a series of small copper cavities. A
Radio Frequency source creates a high electric field in the cavities
which accelerates the electrons, which increases their energy as they
move down the Linac. The RF signal accelerates the electrons, creating
radiation doses, pulsing at 3 million times a second. I have put a link
to a YouTube video explaining how a Linac works.

The source of radiation is from a single point at any one time. The
radiation source is mounted on a ring and can rotate around the patient
in 12 seconds.

Different types of cancers treated with this system offer specific
benefits to the patient:

- [Rectal cancer patients]{.underline} may not require colostomy bags as
more accurate treatment and higher dose can avoid the need for surgery.

- [Prostate Cancer]{.underline} treatment may damage the neurovascular
bundle and lead to erectile dysfunction. MR can see the region and
deliver less radiation here.

- In the treatment of [Pancreatic Cancer,]{.underline} the duodenum, which
is very sensitive to radiation, can receive lower doses as its location
can be seen.

- [Lymph node]{.underline} [Metastasis]{.underline} in the pelvis can be
targeted and treated in one day.

In summary: Survival times for cancer patients may not increase greatly
if survival is already good under current systems, but treatments can be
shortened; side effects diminished and expensive drug therapies reduced
or possibly abandoned.

Currently, there are just 3 Unity MR-Linac units in the UK, but perhaps
with larger trials NICE may be persuaded to install more of these
machines.

The final words; an excellent summary, come from Elekta on the web:

Elekta Unity, the first high field MR/RT system, combines high-field 1.5
Tesla MR imaging, precision radiation therapy and intelligent software,
allowing clinicians to see what they treat in real time. Elekta Unity
addresses a critical unmet need in cancer therapy. Now clinicians can
confidently see and track the tumor and difficult-to-visualize soft
tissue anatomies during treatment and adapt the treatment to optimize
therapy. This enables personalized therapy for each patient and every
treatment session.
