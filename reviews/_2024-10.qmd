**[How Chemical Dyes Changed the West's Relationship with Food]{.underline}**

Food is of interest to us all, and Dr Carolyn Cobbold's presentation to
Science at Fishbourne generated many questions from us, whilst also
revealing that many of us read through the ingredients listed on foods
before we decide to buy.

Food is a combination of chemicals, generally natural chemicals, but
man-made chemicals are now found in most foods, and the question of what
is good for you and what is harmful changes as science and knowledge
changes.

We discovered many interesting facts from the history of food
production; the preservatives and dyes introduced over time, but it was
a revelation to discover that Napolean III, was in part, responsible for
the introduction of the butter substitute: margarine! He was the first
president and last emperor of France; a popular monarch, who oversaw the
modernization of the French economy. He also instigated a competition to
find a cheap substitute for butter which would provide energy for his
troops, and for the workers who were now moving from the land to work in
the towns.

In 1869 Hippolyte- Mege-Mouries, won the competition when he managed to
combine beef tallow with milk.

Margarine continues to be produced today, being made from a variety of
vegetable oils and fat based products and perception as to whether it is
good for you varies from person to person. In the same way, E numbers
present confusion:

from Wikipedia: *"In the UK, food companies are required to include the
\'E Number(s)\' in the ingredients that are added as part of the
manufacturing process. Many components of naturally occurring healthy
foods and vitamins have assigned E numbers (and the number is a synonym
for the chemical component), e.g. [[vitamin
C]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C) ([[E300]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid))
and [[lycopene]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene) ([[E160d]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E160d)),
found in carrots. At the same time, \"E number\" is sometimes
misunderstood to imply approval for safe consumption. This is not
necessarily the case,
e.g. [[Avoparcin]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoparcin) ([[E715]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E715))
is an antibiotic once used in animal feed, but is no longer permitted in
the EU, and has never been permitted for human consumption. [[Sodium
nitrite]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite#Toxicity) (E250)
is toxic. [[Sulfuric
acid]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid) (E513)
is caustic."*

The European Union began to regulate food in 2002 with "The General Food
Law Regulation," and in 2016 introduced legislation which presented food
producers with the obligation to provide nutrition information to the
consumer. They weren't the first to regulate though, for: In 1202, King
John of England proclaimed the first English food law: "The assize of
bread," which prohibited adulteration of bread with such ingredients as
ground peas or beans.

Although there was much confusion when Britain left the EU. Food safety
standards still apply.

Artificial colours were the first man made chemicals legitimised for
foods. A purple dye called mauveine was discovered in 1856 by William
Henry Perkin, an 18-year-old chemist, and research assistant to August
Von Hofmann at the Royal College.

Hoffmann was attempting to make a synthetic form of quinine from coal
tar and Perkin worked on this. He tried to oxidise aniline using
potassium dichromate and, in the process, discovered the resulting
solution turned silk purple.

Synthetic dye factories soon sprung up and the magic of colour entered
the Victorian world. Frank Baum's film; "The Wizard of Oz," gave a
visual insight into the impact of colour at that time.

These aniline dyes were initially used for textiles, they were welcomed
because the colours didn't fade like natural dyes. By 1897 it was
estimated that there were 900 different dyes sold under 8000 trade
names. It was little wonder that the natural dyes used in foods were
gradually replaced by the aniline dyes, with no knowledge as to possible
harms from them.

In 1830, people lived in villages; they grew their food, or knew where I
came from; by 1860, people were now in cities and there was a much
longer food chain, so allowing extra money to be made at each stage. As
well as adding water to milk to make it go further, or flour to mustard,
dyes would improve the look of food, or maybe even extend the shelf life
of food.

Concern for the safety of the dyes had been growing since the 1870s.
Initially, perhaps from dyed clothing producing skin rashes, and then
from children suffering poisoning from coloured sweets. Food chemists
were appointed to check food for safety. Generally, it was easier to
blame, "Foreign food."

In France, the chemist Charles Girard, identified 7 possibly harmful
dyes used in wine and they were banned, but this meant that all other
untested dyes were now considered safe.

Similarly, in Germany, where engineering and synthetic dye production
companies were successfully established, it was vital that the consumer
saw that dyes were safe. Banning metallic dyes in 1887, and
investigating the dyes in sausages in 1899, led to the same result
achieved by French regulators.

In the USA, margarine became the focus of attention as it looked so like
butter. Five states declared that it must be pink rather than yellow.
The USA's approach to dye safety was different; seven dyes, considered
to be safe, were identified, and only these were allowed to be used,
however, just before these were legalised, four of them were changed!

Britain, chose to leave it up to the lawyers who took people to court
for deception (my own great grandfather was fined £91 for deception,
when he sold margarine as butter in 1899.) Leaving decisions to the law,
heralded the introduction of "Expert witnesses" to court cases,
corruption also, no doubt, entered the scene.

Politics, economics, trade, media, and consumer preferences, all now
play their part in food production. There is no true transparency as to
what is safe/not safe. We now have chemicals in foods that didn't exist
prior to the 19^th^ Century, and it's not just the foods but also the
livestock and crops which are subjected to chemicals and antibiotics,
and, as we know from previous talks, human waste charged with
pharmaceuticals is used to fertilize crops.

To end on a lighter note: Despite this, I think we are living longer,
'though I'm sure this statement could be the starting point for much
discussion.
