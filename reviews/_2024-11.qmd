How often do we take water for granted? Gary Mason, made us think
immediately, with a stream of facts. I wonder how many we were aware of:

-   Water shaped our planet ... glaciers, canyons, rivers ...

-   It brought invaders ashore from other lands

-   It remains viable through a cycle of evaporation, condensation,
    precipitation

-   It's a solvent; the process of taking out minerals creates the salty
    seas

-   We humans are 60% water

-   We use it constantly for many things

-   Water is everywhere and we benefit from it

-   Mars, the moon and solar system have water

-   Combustion causes water

-   97.5% of water is in the oceans

-   Only 2.5% is elsewhere, such as ground water, lakes, soil

-   79% is in glaciers. If they melt sea levels will rise

-   Does hot water freeze faster than cold water? ([Mpemba effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasto_B._Mpemba))

-   Are snowflakes all uniquely different?

*Possibly,... "Because the number of deuterium atoms varies in each
snowflake, as does their placement within the ice crystal. Factors,
including temperature, speed, path and humidity, affect each
snowflake\'s unique shape as it forms while falling toward the ground."
(Discover Magazine 2022)*

[What is Water?]{.underline}

It should be a gas as hydrogen and oxygen are both gases. The hydrogen
bonds keep molecules together, so making water, a liquid. Lots of energy
is needed to pull these molecules apart.

It is a universal solvent and can break the chemical bonds of salt,
sugar, iron. Seawater can break down the majority of factory produced
materials.

[What about its properties. Where did it come from and How do we use
it?]{.underline}

Pure H~2~O is not good for health for it would leach out calcium in our
bodies. Hard water is best to drink, as it is a source of calcium.

Solid water -- ice- is less dense and it floats; it acts as an insulator
and organisms can survive beneath the ice. As is cools, density
increases, but beyond 4&deg;C density decreases; water beneath the ice
retains warmth.

Because water molecules stick together, it can move through capillary
action; this is how trees use water; our blood reaches our extremities
via capillary action too. This action has also been used for irrigation
since Ancient Egyptian times.

Mangrove trees live in saline water, but they desalinate sea water in
their roots to give themselves fresh water. Maybe we could copy this
technique? Could it be more sustainable? In Saudi Arabia, de-salination
generally provides their water needs, but the brine, left behind,
damages sea life; recycling of sea water leads to less dilution of the
brine in the sea. It cannot be constantly re-cycled.

Water came to Earth from outside our solar system via asteroids and
meteorites, so creating our atmosphere.

Boiling water, sterilises food. In past times, poor folk would have
their soup pot constantly over the fire, adding to it daily. This is a
safe cooking technique.

Steam also sterilises and is used in hospitals for the cleansing of
equipment.

Dams, can hold water back. This may be beneficial to some but
detrimental to others who no longer have access to the flowing water
further down-stream.

Water extraction from rivers can so reduce flow that only foul
wastewater flows beyond the site of extraction.

The hydrogen, removed from water by a process of electrolysis powered by
solar or hydroelectric energy, is called: Green Hydrogen, as opposed to
black or grey hydrogen created by splitting out water molecules with
heat. It's a clean energy source. Hydrogen has been used since the 19^th^C
to fuel cars, airships and spaceships; it has the potential to replace
fossil fuels; heat homes; power vehicles and power industry.

[Water in History]{.underline}

William Armstrong used hydroelectric power to light an arc lamp in 1878.
Ice houses were introduced into Britain by the wealthy
between 1619-1626, and ice boxes, which were generally wooden, zinc
lined boxes packed with straw or sawdust appeared in the 19^th^ - early
20^th^C.

Steam was one of the most significant developments of the industrial
revolution of 1750 -1900, but explosions occurred before pressure valves
were perfected in the 1800s. Steam power moved from piston to turbine
engines, Turbina being the first turbine driven steamship. It was built
in 1894 as an experiment, and after proving its speed in 1897 led the
way for future turbine steamships.

Steam turbines work when steam expansion causes rotors on turbines to
move the rotating shaft of the generator. The generator produces
electricity; converting mechanical energy to electrical energy. Gas
turbines and wind turbines are also in use today and the internet has
information on [their efficiency](https://alliedpg.com/latest-articles/turbine-efficiency/#:~:text=While%20gas%20turbines%20boast%20a,shaft%20power%20is%20about%2030%25).

Steam generators must use pure water, as your steam iron must. Water
from your clothes dryer (filter out the fabric particles) can be used in
your steam iron.

[Heavy Water]{.underline}

Heavy water, is a coolant and a moderator. Its uses include: nuclear
magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, neutron moderation, neutrino
detection and metabolic rate testing. More information can be found
here: <https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Heavy_water>

To make your own heavy water, you would begin with electrolysis to
separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, but maybe it's best not to. You
can find lots of wild information about this on the internet, and about
other items covered in Gary's talk.

After our coffee break, there were many questions and concerns raised,
some were about materials and how they work; such as goretex : "*The
microscopic pores on the membrane are 20,000 times smaller than a water
droplet, which means water droplets can\'t pass through."*

Much concern was shown for products containing Teflon, and
micro-plastics from washing machines were discussed. I think we are all
focussed on the problems of pollution and on how we are affecting our
planet. Sewage and waste water treatments and the proposed reverse
osmosis system at Southern water were also discussed. On a personal
level, I am now becoming a Rep for Surfers Against Sewage, having been
concerned when walking on the beach each day. Sewage discharges from
sewage overflows happen almost weekly at Pagham, frequently at
Chichester harbour; Langstone harbour; Middleton and Bognor. We know
this is a complex problem from previous talks here, but it's an urgent
problem.

I was heartened to hear of the reed beds (nature's filtration system)
incorporated into house building at Hambrook, for I believe that nature
has the answers we need, and this demands a re-think as to how systems
operate: "*The open space will bring biodiversity net gain, through a
diverse strategy including ponds with reed beds, wild grass, retained
hedgerows and trees, plus an orchard." *
