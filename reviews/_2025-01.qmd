I think many of us were unsure of what we would discover from today's presentation. I once
looked after a xenopus for a few years, so I knew a little about the African, clawed frog, but
today, I discovered so much more.

Matt Guille is professor of Developmental Genetics at Portsmouth University, where he set
up an independent lab working on gene regulation in Xenopus, and in 2006 this led to the
inception of the European Xenopus Resource Centre funded by the Wellcome Trust.

Xenopus, since the 1940s, was used for pregnancy testing: urine from a pregnant woman, if
injected under the skin of the frog, would cause it to produce eggs. However, for over 50
years, Xenopus, has been a model for biomedical research, leading to many ground-
breaking discoveries.

At first xenopus was used to discover the basics of biology, such as: what makes blood form;
and what networks are used by genes, later, building upon those discoveries, has led to the
use of xenopus as a model for diseases.

Various model organisms having a similar genome to humans, have been used over the
years, and the ethics of using these models has long been debated. More consideration for
the ethics of animal research has prevailed in the 21st century. In recent years, the mouse
was generally most favoured, having close similarities to the human genome, but the frog,
which also has a similar genome, is considered less sentient than a mouse and so is widely
used as a model. Xenous laevis is also very hardy. It can live in extreme environments and is
nocturnal. It can produce eggs all year round, and it is these embryos that are generally
employed for research.

Big data and mathematical modelling form a part of research as do Organoids (cell cultures),
but though organoids may be the tool of the future, the advancement in this technique is
slow, and mathematical modelling can only result from data achieved through the use of
animal models.

An early breakthrough in the understanding of how molecules can cause change, was
through an experiment worked on by Hilda Mangold under the direction of Hans Spemann.
She transplanted cells from the dorsal lip of a newt embryo onto its ventral side, and
discovered that transplanted cells were instructing, or inducing, neighbouring cells to
migrate and adopt specific cell fates. she observed that an entire neural tube and brain
would form at the site of the transplant; effectively creating a new newt embryo. In 1990
Richard Harland discovered the molecules that caused this change. The process led to the
creation of what is termed an "Organiser."

Portsmouth University now has 1024 tanks full of frogs (these can live for at least 15 years),
and freezers full of cells from organisms. The Resource centre, which supplies frogs to other
countries, is well funded at present and has some top of the range technology in the form of
microscopes with zeiss lenses which also act similarly to CT scanners.

The "100,000 genome project," helped cement the NHS's position as one of the most
advanced healthcare systems in the world, and helped lay the foundation for a new era
of personalised medicine. Along with cancer, the Project looked at the whole genomes of
people affected by rare disease to try and identify any genetic variations that might be
causing symptoms.

Xenopus can quickly be genetically altered to study rare genetic diseases. One in seventeen
people are born with a rare genetic disease and one in twenty have a rare gene variant.
This year, two new therapies have emerged from gene sequencing and research using
xenopus.

For one child, Jessica, who suffered from severe epileptic fits, it was discovered that a
change in diet was all that was required.

In the past, the cost of multiple tests to detect disease in a child might cost £345,000; now
gene sequencing and the use of CRISPR techniques with RNA injected into frogs can bring
results in just over 2 days at very little cost.

Xenopus laevis and the smaller xenopus tropicalis are now at the forefront of research and
are beginning to be used clinically.

Science research criteria is changing. In the past, the top requisite was: "Scientific
excellence," but now it's: "Value for money."

Britain has the lead in this.

There is so much more to discover in this field, particularly the use of viral vectors for
targeting disease.

Below I put links to sites I have referred to in writing this. I hope you find them useful.
