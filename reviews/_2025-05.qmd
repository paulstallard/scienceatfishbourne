This month, Science at Fishbourne, welcomed **Dr Tony Whitbred, former
Chief Executive of the Sussex Wildlife Trust**. We always look forward
to his talks, learning something new each year. You can find my review
of his talk last year: **"There is No Wealth but Life,"**
[here](/previous/2024-07.html).

Dr Whitbred, began with some facts about **The Sun;** the star at
the centre of our solar system; our source of heat and light, radiating
energy equivalent to 2 billion atom bombs per second, or a boiling
kettle every 2 sq m. That energy has been intercepted by plants over the
past 3 ½ billion years. It then flows from plants to herbivores and on
to carnivores. The energy, decreases as it goes through each layer of
life's pyramid, dissipating through the environment, so that only about
10% is carried forward into each layer.

Plants are more abundant where warmth is consistent and sunlight and
water are present, and so climate affects which plants and animals will
be found around the globe.

Ocean currents, play their part in our climate, making it warmer than it
should be, considering our latitude. The Gulf Stream brings warm water
from near the equator to our region. Overturning circulation is a system
of ocean currents which form a vertical loop across the Atlantic Ocean,
where warm surface water is carried from the Equator to the poles. Here,
the water cools, sinks and returns at depth, towards the equator.

In Sussex our climate is influenced by remnant areas of the Atlantic
micro climate, and by the Continental Climate (having more extremes than
a temperate climate). The geography of the Downs, once a huge chalk dome
which extended across Sussex, Surrey and North Kent, now eroded by
weathering and time, has a complex geology of greensand, clay and chalk.

Sussex habitats are naturally affected by geography and climate, and
Tony gave us a glimpse of the different species to be found in some of
the 32 Sussex Nature Reserves:

**Eridge Rocks,** a majestic outcrop of sandstone amidst woodland, in
the **High Weald** (between Crowborough and Tunbridge Wells) is not
typical of Sussex. Influenced by the Atlantic micro climate, it provides
a habitat for plants such as: Tunbridge Filmy Fern and Greater Whipwort;
these plants like a moist, stable environment, and are more commonly
found in the Lake District and Wales.

**Ashdown Forest, Steadham and Iping Commons,** share the geology of the
Ashdown Beds (sandstone and siltstone layers). The **Green Sand Ridge**
provides **Heathland habitats of acidic, well-drained soil** for **Ling,
Bell and Cross-leaved** **heather, and Bilberries.** The low calcium,
low nutrient soils allow species such as **Sundew** to evolve and catch
flies. Insect species, such as the Golden Winged dragonfly and the
Silver Studded blue butterfly (which has a symbiotic relationship with
ants); the Heath crab spider; the Woodlark, Dartford Warbler and
Stonechat.

**Graffam Common** (On the Greensand Ridge) was purchased, as a conifer
plantation, by Sussex Wildlife Trust around 15 years ago. By discussion
with local people heathland was re-established and Woodlark and Nightjar
were provided with a habitat.

**Weald woodlands** in the west are: **"Ebernoe,"** a managed woodland
where rides have been grazed and cut and nightingales sing; and **"The
Mens,"** bought in 1974 then left as a non-intervention site. Here,
rare, Bechstein's and Barbastelle bats are found. Bats use the entire
landscape and can travel 30kms a night. More trees and hedges have been
planted to link up these woodlands, so providing Bat Corridors for their
movement, and the bat population has doubled.

More traditional woodlands, examples of countryside as it was in the
past, are at **Woods Mill**, the headquarters of The Sussex Wildlife
Trust.

Wood anemones, like waterlogged, clay soils; they are slow to colonise,
and so if found on verges, they may indicate ancient woodland habitats.
Bluebells attract many visitors to our woodlands. They need open sites
to establish and so respond well to coppicing. They are weaker
indicators of ancient woodland.

**Chalk Grasslands found at Levin Down, Ditchling Beacon and Malling
Down,** are highly species rich sites, where no one species dominates.
Here, plants thrive in nutrient poor soils which offer a habitat built
on calcium carbonate. 40 species may be found in 1 sq m. Here you will
find Pyramid Orchids, Bee Orchids and, "The Pride of Sussex --
Round-Headed Rampion," as well as the Adonis Blue butterfly.

Sussex also has some of the richest **wetlands** in Europe, such as
**Amberley Wild brooks**, where Bewick Swans, Lapwings, Egrets and Sea
Eagles may be seen together with the Emperor Dragonfly and the Lesser
Whirlpool, Ramshorn Snail. In the reedbeds there are Water Rail and
Bearded Tits.

**Pevensey Marshes,** though not open to the public, is a site of
specific scientific interest; managed with the help of grazing
livestock.

**Rye Harbour Nature Reserve and Discovery Centre** is described as one
of the largest and most important wildlife sites in England. This is an
accreting coastline, and the town of Rye, once a seaside fishing
community, is now 2 miles from the coast. Shingle has built up and
provides a low nutrient location for certain specific plants such as the
Yellow Long-Horned Poppy. Some endangered birds, such as the Little Tern
and Wheatear, also depend on this habitat.

**Does Nature Need Managing?**

This is a complex issue. Humans, have, through agriculture,
deforestation, and pollution, disrupted natural processes and
ecosystems, and there are missing links in the chain of biodiversity. In
the past, land mammals, grazed in woodlands and grasslands, so managing
plant growth and adding to the nutrients in soils. There were also
predators higher in the food chain, helping to keep the balance. There
is therefore, a need for some management and restoration to help nature
to recover.

Forms of management include: coppicing and clearing of trees to allow
light into woodland, - even cutting into trees to create bat habitats-;
reintroducing grazing on land; maintaining wild flower meadows and
hedgerows; maintaining water levels in wetlands and overall, managing
conditions for biodiversity.

Currently, local authorities, farmers, land users and community groups
are working together to create networks and corridors through which
nature can connect from one area to another. Locally, on the Manhood
Peninsula, groups such as RSPB and the Manhood Wildlife and Heritage
Group have been planting hundreds of trees and hedgerows, with the help
of volunteers. There are funds available for this from local
authorities, companies and Private Trusts.

**BETTER, BIGGER, MORE, and JOINED** were Dr Whitbred's final words for
future action.

Currently various policies on nature are under review and need public
action. I add some links here should you be interested:

Sussex is a wonderful county because of its micro climates and diverse
geology. For more detailed information, the varied habitats covered by
