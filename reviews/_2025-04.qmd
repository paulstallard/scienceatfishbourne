Tom Cherrett, Professor of Logistics and Transport Management at
Southampton University, gave a fascinating insight into the use of
drones locally, and globally, and opened up a whole new train of thought
related to the movement of medical products and -- in this
fast-developing field of transport (quite scarily) - cups of coffee!

The construction of drones is ongoing, and each design has different
capabilities:

A "Windracer **fixed wing drone**," was the first pilotless craft to
deliver medical supplies, from Cornwall, to the Isles of Scilly
in December 2020. 

**Helicopter drones**, capable of vertical take- off, are used in air
sea rescue operations.

**Multicopter drones** also have vertical take- off, and so, unlike the
fixed wing drones, they need no extra space. They are also able to
hover, making them ideal for surveillance and imaging. They have a wide
range of uses.

**Hybrid drones,** combine fixed wing with rotors, for vertical take-
off. They also utilise two or more forms of energy, allowing for longer
flight times and heavier payloads.

Drones have many uses from crop spraying and life- saving rescue
services, to acting as sheep dogs to herd various animals; from creating
light shows in the sky to scanning barcodes in warehouses. Drones are
also used in warfare, and for less than £1000, it's possible to 3D print
a drone capable of taking out a tank!

In Australia, a company called: "Wing Aviation," (a subsidiary of
Google's parent company: Alphabet) began, five years ago, to deliver
household items; 30% of these items were cups of coffee.

Residents in Gunghalin, Canberra, started a petition against the
deliveries, and 1,043 people signed it. Their reasons included: limited
opportunity for the public to give feedback on this trial, and potential
risks to pets and wildlife, together with the right to enjoy peace,
privacy and a good quality of life. Deliveries in Canberra have since
ceased, but are ongoing in Queensland.

Residents in Dublin, Ireland, have also been expressing concerns, since,
"Manna Aeronautics," began delivering food there a year ago. Their
drones fly at 50mph and can carry 8.8lbs, delivering to homes within 3
minutes. These flights, in public airspace have regulatory oversight.
The company are expanding their operations despite public concerns;
(Maybe residents should read the report on the Australian protest --

In the UK, drones which go beyond the line of sight need to have a
temporary danger area permit (An area that could endanger aircraft).
Professor Cherrett, managed to obtain a permit in order to test fly a
large drone to the Isle of Wight on 9^th^ May 2020, with the intention
of investigating drone use by the NHS (Covid19 led to less movement in
airspace and so helped to secure this trial flight).

In the field of logistics, drones, could be useful for transporting
medical payloads; they could be beneficial to the NHS. Currently, every
GP surgery is visited by van, twice a day, to collect medical samples
and the accompanying paperwork. The samples are taken to Portsmouth or
Southampton for analysis. Isle of Wight surgeries, also need to add
travel by ferry to the journey. For doctors awaiting the results of
blood tests, time is important, and the vans, travelling from one GP
surgery to the next before arriving at the relevant hospital, take up
precious time. The question is, can drones improve this service?

Integrated logistics is the answer: the use of vans, electric bicycles,
and drone use to more remote areas. The 500 patient transfer vehicles
used here in the south, could also transport medicines and samples.

There is still much to consider, such as: who loads the drones? How are
the samples/results/medicines delivered from the drone, to the
surgery/NHS? What type of packaging is best for a smooth ride (They need
to be crash-proof)? How will drugs, such as chemotherapy drugs respond
to the movement and vibration of the journey? Can drones lift the
necessary weight? How does weather affect the delivery? Are drones
reliable? How about safe use of the air space, without causing a
nuisance or danger to wildlife?

All of the above are being worked on and drones will, no doubt, be seen
more frequently.

According to an article published in 2023, the UK is set for the world's
largest and longest drone superhighway following a £5 million deal
between Etc (A department within British Telecom) and "Altitude Angel,"
(There is a link below).

I don't know how you feel about this new technology? There are many
benefits when used as Professor Cherrett suggests, for example: quicker
delivery; less fuel used and a reduction of emissions; but, as shown by
the people of Dublin and Canberra, there could be a battle ahead with
regards to commercial, profit driven deliveries, and the detrimental
impact posed by this technology.
