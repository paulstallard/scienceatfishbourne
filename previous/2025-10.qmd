# Overview

This will be a network of one way Eways for lightweight ‘Ecars’ using the margins between the fence-lines either side of major road and rail routes and elevated across open land. For the road sections of door-to-door journeys Ecars would use their internal short-range batteries and when on the Eways will pick up power for recharge and high-speed traction and be automatically controlled.
