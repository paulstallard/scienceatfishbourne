# Overview

The talk describes the devastating effects of pandemics such as plague, TB and smallpox, prior to the advent of vaccination.
I describe how the remarkable Lady Mary Wortley Montague, wife of the Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, introduced a process known as variolation, which greatly reduced deaths from smallpox.
Vaccination proper starts with Edward Jenner, who used cowpox to protect people against smallpox, after an outrageous experiment on his gardener’s son!
The star of the talk is Louis Pasteur, who develops vaccines against a variety of diseases.
I explain how the early 20th century saw increasingly widespread outbreaks of polio and how Jonas Salk developed the first vaccine against it.
I finish by describing how mRNA vaccines were developed to fight Covid.
